# Data and Analysis

All of the data and most of the analysis scripts are retained in the github repository https://github.com/mikeblazanin/trav-phage. 

Cleanup_Data.R is an R script that converts the raw data files stored in Raw_Data/ into consistent format data files stored in Clean_Data/. 

Analyze_Data.R is an R script that analyzes and visualized the clean data files from Clean_Data/.

Modeling data is generated by Matlab scripts located in the repo at https://github.com/jeremymoore558/ks_phage. Copies of the modeling data outputs are stored in the Modeling/ subdirectories. Visualization of the modeling data is done by Visualize_ModelOutput.R.

#Setup
To re-run the code in this repo, clone the repo then open the associated R Project file. The `renv` package should automatically bootstrap itself, downloading and installing the appropriate version of `renv` into the project library. Once this has completed, run
```
renv::restore()
```

This will install all package dependencies in the version used for our analyses. Then, you can run `Analyze_Data.R` or `Visualize_ModelOutput.R` to generate figures.
